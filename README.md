Groundwater Quality Prediction Project
Overview

This project predicts groundwater quality for drinking, bathing, and irrigation using water parameters like pH, EC, Hardness, and TDS. The work is completed over three weeks covering data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, and model training.

Week-wise Work
Week 1 (week1.ipynb): Data preprocessing – missing values, encoding, scaling, and removing low-variance columns. Output: cleaned_data.csv.
Week 2 (week2.ipynb): EDA, feature selection, feature transformation, and water quality classification. Output: water_quality_classified.csv.
Week 3 (groundwater_predictor.ipynb): Model training, evaluation, predictions, and interactive groundwater quality prediction. Output: final_water_predictions.csv.

How to Run
Open notebooks in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Run notebooks sequentially: Week 1 → Week 2 → Week 3.
Use the interactive sliders in groundwater_predictor.ipynb to predict water quality.
